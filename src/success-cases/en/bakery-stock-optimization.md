title: "How a Local Bakery Connected Its Sales, Inventory, and Suppliers"
date: "2025-07-26"
industry: "Retail"
clientName: "Delicias Bakery"
mainAchievement: "Saved 10+ hours weekly by eliminating manual data entry"
challenge: "The owner was spending hours every night manually cross-referencing sales from their simple POS with a separate inventory spreadsheet and then drafting supplier emails. This led to ordering mistakes and wasted time that could have been spent on the business."
solution: "We built a custom automation using n8n that acts as the central hub for the bakery's operations. When a sale is made, the workflow instantly updates a master inventory list in Google Sheets and logs the transaction in their accounting software. Crucially, when an ingredient like flour drops below a set threshold, the system automatically generates and sends a purchase order to the correct supplier via email."
results:
    - "Eliminated over 10 hours of manual data entry and admin work per week."
    - "Reduced ingredient waste by 40% by ordering based on real-time data."
    - "Ensured key ingredients were always in stock, increasing customer satisfaction."
testimonial: "I used to spend my evenings staring at three different apps and a spreadsheet. Now, they all work together like a single, smart employee. SmartNode gave me my evenings back to focus on what I love—baking."
