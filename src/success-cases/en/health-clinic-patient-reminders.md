title: "How a Health Clinic Reduced Patient No-Shows and Admin Work"
date: "2024-12-05"
industry: "Healthcare"
clientName: "Wellness & Therapy Center"
mainAchievement: "30% reduction in patient no-shows"
challenge: "The clinic's staff spent hours each week manually sending appointment reminders and follow-up emails. Their booking system (Calendly) and patient records (stored in a secure database) were disconnected, leading to missed reminders and patient no-shows."
solution: "We created an n8n workflow that connects their systems. When an appointment is booked, the automation schedules an SMS reminder to be sent 24 hours beforehand. After the appointment, it automatically sends a follow-up email with relevant care instructions and resources. All interactions are logged in the patient's record."
results:
    - "Reduced patient no-shows by 30%, saving thousands in lost revenue."
    - "Freed up 8 hours of weekly administrative work for the front desk staff."
    - "Improved patient care with consistent and timely follow-up information."
testimonial: "This automation does more than save us timeâ€”it improves the patient experience. Our patients feel cared for, and our staff can focus on providing that care instead of being buried in admin tasks."
