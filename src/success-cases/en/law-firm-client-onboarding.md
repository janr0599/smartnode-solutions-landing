title: "How a Law Firm Automated New Client Onboarding"
date: "2025-01-15"
industry: "Legal"
clientName: "Apex Legal Group"
mainAchievement: "90% reduction in administrative time for new client intake"
challenge: "The firm's lawyers were wasting valuable, non-billable hours on administrative tasks for every new client: creating folders, sending welcome packets, scheduling initial meetings, and manually entering data into their case management system."
solution: "We designed an n8n workflow triggered by a signed client agreement from DocuSign. The automation instantly creates a new client folder in Google Drive with a standardized sub-folder structure, adds the client's info to their case management tool (Clio), sends a personalized welcome email with an intake questionnaire, and schedules the initial consultation on the lawyer's calendar."
results:
    - "Reduced non-billable administrative time for client intake by 90%."
    - "Eliminated data entry errors and ensured a consistent onboarding experience."
    - "Allowed lawyers to focus on legal work from the moment a client is signed."
testimonial: "The first few hours with a new client are critical. This automation handles all the paperwork instantly, so I can focus on building a relationship and strategy from minute one. It's an incredible advantage."
