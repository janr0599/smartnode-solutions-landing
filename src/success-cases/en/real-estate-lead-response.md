title: "How a Real Estate Agent Captured and Responded to Leads Instantly"
date: "2025-05-20"
industry: "Real Estate"
clientName: "Prestige Properties"
mainAchievement: "5x faster lead response time, leading to a 40% increase in scheduled viewings"
challenge: "Leads were coming in from Zillow, the company website, and social media, but the agent couldn't respond fast enough. By the time they manually entered the lead into their CRM and sent an email, the prospect had often moved on."
solution: "We built an n8n automation that centralizes all incoming leads. The moment a lead comes in from any source, the workflow adds them to a HubSpot CRM, instantly sends a personalized SMS and email to the lead, and creates a task for the agent in Todoist to follow up with a call. This all happens within 60 seconds."
results:
    - "Increased lead response speed from over an hour to under one minute."
    - "Achieved a 40% increase in the number of property viewings scheduled."
    - "Provided a professional and immediate first impression to every potential client."
testimonial: "In real estate, speed is everything. This automation is my secret weapon. I'm connecting with hot leads while my competitors are still checking their email."
